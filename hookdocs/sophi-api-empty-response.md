If the Sophi API returns an empty Post ID array, the plugin will result in a "no results" response.  The `sophi_curated_post_list` filter can be used to modify the Sophi API response to allow manual posts to be injected into the final array previous to returning the filterable value from `posts_pre_query` (e.g., via a fallback method to inject posts that would be a good fit).

WordPress VIP-compatible plugin for the Sophi.io Site Automation service.

== Description ==

[Sophi.io](https://www.sophi.io) is a suite of artificial intelligence (AI) tools developed by [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/) to help content publishers make important strategic and tactical decisions. The tools range from automated content curation engines to predictive analytics and paywall solutions.

Sophi-driven pages outperform human curated pages by a significant margin and free up publisher resources so that they can focus on finding the next story that matters. Invisible, automated curation of your home and section pages to streamline your teamâ€™s workflow. Continuously optimize the performance characteristics of the site based on demand and your brand, so the content is always the right fit.

**Note that a [Sophi.io account](https://www.sophi.io/contact/) and related credentials are required in order to authorize and authenticate access within the plugin settings.**

== Highlights of Sophi.io service ==

* An automation platform capable of transforming your business.
* State of the art natural language processing to enable prediction and optimization.
* Tomorrowâ€™s publishers rely on Sophi to better understand their audience and make sure every pixel is used to drive value efficiently and effectively.
* **Sophi Automation:** Automates your digital content curation to display your most valuable content in the most valuable places on your website, on social media and in newsletters.
* **Sophi Dive:** Uses your historical data to help content publishers and editors determine what content to produce more or less of and what to stop doing all together â€” which enables intelligent decision-making around resource allocation.
* **Sophi Now:** Equips you with analytics that provide real-time, tactical decision support that can tell you what content to promote more prominently, or less prominently; find out whatâ€™s over-performing and underperforming on a particular page; and find out why a particular article is doing well or not (for example, is it driving subscriptions, helping retain subscribers, getting traction on social media, search or newsletters, etc.) and where readers are coming from and going next on your website.
* **Sophi Next:** Flags a short list of articles that have just been published (but not promoted anywhere) that are likely to be your most valuable content going forward. This helps editors decide which headlines to place on a particular page â€” helping them find the hidden gems.
* **Sophi for Paywalls:** A fully dynamic, real-time paywall engine that understands both content and users and can optimize for several outcomes and offers simultaneously.

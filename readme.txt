WordPress VIP-compatible plugin for the Sophi.io Site Automation service.

== Description ==

[Sophi.io](https://www.sophi.io) is a suite of artificial intelligence (AI) tools developed by [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/) to help content publishers make important strategic and tactical decisions. The tools range from automated content curation engines to predictive analytics and paywall solutions.

Sophi-driven pages outperform human curated pages by a significant margin and free up publisher resources so that they can focus on finding the next story that matters. Invisible, automated curation of your home and section pages to streamline your teamâ€™s workflow. Continuously optimize the performance characteristics of the site based on demand and your brand, so the content is always the right fit.

**Note that a [Sophi.io account](https://www.sophi.io/contact/) and related credentials are required in order to authorize and authenticate access within the plugin settings.**

== Highlights of Sophi.io service ==

* An automation platform capable of transforming your business.
* State of the art natural language processing to enable prediction and optimization.
* Tomorrowâ€™s publishers rely on Sophi to better understand their audience and make sure every pixel is used to drive value efficiently and effectively.
* **Sophi Automation:** Automates your digital content curation to display your most valuable content in the most valuable places on your website, on social media and in newsletters.
* **Sophi Dive:** Uses your historical data to help content publishers and editors determine what content to produce more or less of and what to stop doing all together â€” which enables intelligent decision-making around resource allocation.
* **Sophi Now:** Equips you with analytics that provide real-time, tactical decision support that can tell you what content to promote more prominently, or less prominently; find out whatâ€™s over-performing and underperforming on a particular page; and find out why a particular article is doing well or not (for example, is it driving subscriptions, helping retain subscribers, getting traction on social media, search or newsletters, etc.) and where readers are coming from and going next on your website.
* **Sophi Next:** Flags a short list of articles that have just been published (but not promoted anywhere) that are likely to be your most valuable content going forward. This helps editors decide which headlines to place on a particular page â€” helping them find the hidden gems.
* **Sophi for Paywalls:** A fully dynamic, real-time paywall engine that understands both content and users and can optimize for several outcomes and offers simultaneously.

== Installation ==

*Note that if you are on the [WordPress VIP](https://wpvip.com/) platform that you will not be able to upload a plugin in the WordPress Admin so you will need to follow steps in 1b.*

1a Download plugin ZIP file and upload to your site.
You can upload and install the [archived (zip) plugin](https://github.com/globeandmail/sophi-for-wordpress/archive/stable.zip) via the WordPress dashboard (`Plugins` > `Add New` -> `Upload Plugin`) or manually inside of the `wp-content/plugins` directory, and activate on the Plugins dashboard.

1b Download or Clone this repo, install dependencies, and build.
- `git clone https://github.com/globeandmail/sophi-for-wordpress.git && cd sophi-for-wordpress`
- `composer install && npm install && npm run build`

2 Activate Plugin
Click the `Activate` link after installing the plugin.

3 Configure plugin settings
Go to `Settings` > `Sophi` in the WordPress Admin and enter your Sophi Collector and Site Automation credentials supplied by the [Sophi.io](https://www.sophi.io/contact/) team.  Click `Save Changes` button to validate and save your credentials.

Once your credentials are validated and saved, your site is officially supercharged by the Sophi.io Site Automation service.  You also have access to Sophi for WordPress' powerful WP_Query parameters and custom Sophi Site Automation block, which enables you to utilize Site Automation to power the content curation on your site.

== Usage ==

There are two ways that Sophi Site Automation results can be included in a WordPress site, via a Site Automation block and a direct integration with WP_Query.  More details on each of these options are described below.

= Site Automation block =

You can utilize the Site Automation Block, configure the Site Automation page and widget name, and adjust block content and meta settings to display Site Automation content on your site.

![Sophi Site Automation block.](https://github.com/globeandmail/sophi-for-wordpress/.wordpress-org/screenshot-2.png)

The Site Automation block comes with a barebone HTML output and styling. It's made to be filtered using `sophi_site_automation_block_output`.

`
add_filter(
	'sophi_site_automation_block_output',
	function( $output, $curated_posts, $attributes, $content, $block ) {
		// ...
		return $new_output;
	},
	10,
	5
);
`

= Query integration =

The Site Automation block uses query integration under the hood. You can query for Sophi curated articles by passing `sophi_curated_page` and `sophi_curated_widget` to your WP_Query queries.

`
$the_query = new WP_Query( [
	'sophi_curated_page'   => 'page-name',
	'sophi_curated_widget' => 'widget-name',
] );
`

**Sync content to Sophi Collector**

`$ wp sophi sync [--post_types=<string>] [--limit=<number>] [--per_page=<number>] [--include=<number>]`

Sync all supported content to Sophi Collector, firing off update events for all of them.  The expected use case with the Sophi for WordPress plugin is that someone will install it on an existing site and instead of having to manually update each piece of content to ensure that it makes it to the Collector, they can run this script to handle that all at once.

Post types to be processed. Comma separated for passing multiple post types.

default: `false`
options:
- any post type name
- `false`

**`--limit=<number>`**

default: `false`
options:
- `false`, no limit
- `N`, max number of posts to sync

**`--per_page=<number>`**
